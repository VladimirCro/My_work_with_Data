I am analizing subcontractor invoices for period January 2017 - May 2023.
This is case study to discover trends and relations over years.
It might be unclear in some aspects for person who is not familiar with other causes that are not related to this data.
So this should be look just like showcase of data analisis.
This are raw conclusion without proper processing for presentation purpose.

1. I joined tabels on subcontractor invoices for given period
	- data entery tables are not systemized
	- tables and data entery is non consistant
	- over years different people worked on same job entery so there is difference in way data is procesed and stored
	- all previous data values were recalculated on currency from kn to €, EUR is official currency from 01.01.2023

2. Data cleaning and grouping 
	- all data was entered by humans and it was prone to mistakes
	- data entery was not systemized so enteries are non consistant, there were no restrictions on columns
	- job was removing spaces, strange characters, wrong enteries, parsing dates, setting dates to date-time format
	- choosing unique name for each subcontractor, standardizing enteries to enable grouping data  

3. Work with data
	- setting cumulative expensis column
	- data grouping - by subcontracter name and by years
		
4. Visualisation relevant data
	-using apropriate graphs to show relevant information

5. Data analisys	
	- "ANALIZA TROŠKA 2017-2023" - observation of entire time period
		Graph 1. Highest expensis are in 2022, lowest are 2021, year 2023 is excluded from analisys because only 5 month are applied
		Graph 2. Difference between highest and lowest expense years is 4% of total exspense, that equals 273.066,20 €, 
			 what is considered significant amount 25,27 % of average year subcontractor invoices
			 Lowest expenses were in 2021, that is year when firm "Frigooprema" was excluded from preventive maintenance, 
			 and company established its own branch in that part of buisness, also 2021 was COVID related year,
			 to understand this further we would need to look into other buisness data
		Graph 3. Most dominant subcontractor is "Cooling and Heating" with 1.413.561,18 € of invoices in given period
		Graph 4. We observe that top 4  subcontractors take 53% of total amount in given period
			 This subcontractors are hired for different part of Croatia to provide contracted services
		Graph 5. & 6. We observe importance of top 10 subcontractors - they took 69% of total amount
			 In mentioned 69% of top 10, top 4 are participating with 77%

		- CONCLUSION: 	As data is showing during relevant time period we conclude consistency in subcontractors expensis with 4 subcontractors dominating
				Top 4 subcontractors are fields that company relays on outsorcing. and two companys that are hired for maintenance in parts of Croatia
				where company doesnt have its own workfore and manegament				


	- "GODIŠNJI PREGLED" - we are observing expenses over years for all subcontractors
		Histograms. - There is no obvious pattern of expenses to conclude they are more extensive in one part of year over the other, 
			      as most of company subcontractors are related to whole year maintenace 
		Pie charts. - we can observe there is trend of dispersing subcontractor expensis: 2018 -> "others" 11%, 2022 -> "others" 30%
			    - this is good trend because it is better to relay on smaller subcontractors for various resons that I wont mention here

	- "TOP 4" - we are looking into average monthly subcontractor invoice, idea is to look into data to see if there is place to take this part of buisness 
		    and do it with own resources
		  - it is required to further calculate how much would it cost to set this part of buisness
